        Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb
        engineer. Armstrong enrolled in the Y Combinator startup incubator
        program and received a $150,000 cash infusion. Fred Ehrsam, a former
        Goldman Sachs trader, later joined as a co-founder. British programmer
        and Blockchain.info co-founder Ben Reeves was originally supposed to be
        part of the Coinbase founding team but parted ways with Armstrong just
        before the Y Combinator funding event, due to their different stands on
        how the Coinbase wallet should operate. The company is named after
        Coinbase transactions, which are special transactions that introduce
        cryptocurrency into circulation in proof of work cryptocurrencies. 8 In
        October 2012 the company launched the services to buy and sell bitcoins
        through bank transfers.
